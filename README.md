HealthHub - AI Mental Wellness for Youth
HealthHub is an AI-powered, confidential, and empathetic mental wellness platform designed to support and guide youth in overcoming the stigma associated with seeking help. This project was developed by Dragon Coders for the Gen AI Exchange Hackathon.


🚩 The Problem
Many young people hesitate to seek mental health support due to stigma, fear of judgment, and the lack of truly safe spaces. This leads to a silent struggle for countless individuals who need support but don't know where to turn. HealthHub was created to bridge this critical gap.

✨ Our Solution
HealthHub provides a secure and anonymous web-based platform where young individuals can freely express their feelings and receive immediate, empathetic support from an AI assistant. Our solution creates personalized daily therapy and workout plans based on the user's mood, journal entries, and emotional patterns, helping them build healthier habits and overcome stigma.
